**Live Demo:** [https://aaron1798.github.io/KentStateAirport-PersonalProject/]

## Project Overview

This project is a conceptual, responsive front-end website developed as my Computer Science capstone project during my senior year at Kent State University. It explores the **"what if" scenario** of transforming Kent State's educational airport into a commercial hub for public use, drawing inspiration from successful models like Illinois State University and Purdue University. The goal was to showcase the potential for a modern, user-friendly online presence for such a commercial operation, demonstrating key functionalities and intuitive design.

## Features

* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
* **Multi-Page Navigation:** Includes essential customer-facing sections such as:
    * Home Page
    * Flights (conceptual flight information)
    * Account Management
    * Login/Registration
    * Support/Contact
* **Intuitive User Interface:** Designed with a focus on clean layouts and easy navigation to enhance the user experience.
* **Conceptual Commercial Operations:** Models the user flow and information presentation typical of a public-facing airport website.
